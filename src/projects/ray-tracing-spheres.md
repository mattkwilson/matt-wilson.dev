**Project Type:** Shader

**Team:** Solo

**Platform:** Shadertoy

**Stack:** GLSL, OpenGL

**Release:** Shadertoy - Dec 2022

**Description:** This project uses ray tracing to render a simple scene of spheres and planes varying in reflectivity. All objects are defined within the fragment shader, including a camera and view frustum. Lighting is calculated using the [Blinn-Phong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinn%E2%80%93Phong_reflection_model) shading model. Ray tracing is done using an iterative algorithm (as GLSL does not support recursion).

**Player Controls:** Click and drag on the viewport to move the light source.
